# 🩺 DermAssist AI — Skin Cancer Screening App

An AI-powered web application that analyzes skin lesion images and gives you an instant risk assessment. Upload a photo from your phone or computer and the AI will tell you whether the lesion looks concerning — and what to do next.

> ⚠️ **This is a screening tool, not a medical diagnosis.** Always consult a dermatologist for any skin concerns.

## 🧠 How the AI Works 

The AI model was trained on the **ISIC HAM10000 dataset** — a collection of 10,015 real dermoscopy images of skin lesions, each labeled by expert dermatologists.

### Training Steps (What We Did)

**1. Data Preparation**
- Loaded 10,015 labeled images across 7 skin lesion types
- Split them: 80% for training, 10% for validation, 10% for testing
- Since some lesion types had very few photos (e.g. Dermatofibroma had ~100, Melanocytic Nevi had ~6,700), we duplicated the rare ones multiple times to balance it out — this is called **oversampling**

**2. Image Preprocessing (Before Training)**
Each image goes through a cleaning pipeline before the AI sees it:
- **Hair removal (Dull-Razor)** — removes dark hair strands that confuse the AI, using a technique called "blackhat filtering + inpainting"
- **Resize to 224×224 pixels** — all images must be the same size
- **Normalize pixel values to 0–1** — converts colors from 0–255 range to 0–1 for stable math

**3. Model Architecture (MobileNetV2)**
We used **MobileNetV2** — a pre-trained image recognition model from Google — as the base. This is called **Transfer Learning**: instead of training from scratch, we start with a model that already knows how to recognize shapes, textures, and colors, and then fine-tune it for skin lesions.

On top of MobileNetV2, we added:
- A **GlobalAveragePooling** layer — compresses the image features into a single vector
- A **Dense(256)** layer with L2 regularization — learns skin-specific patterns
- A **Dropout(0.5)** layer — randomly turns off neurons during training to prevent overfitting
- A final **Dense(7, softmax)** layer — outputs a probability for each of the 7 lesion classes

**4. Training**
- Trained for up to 10 epochs with early stopping
- Used custom class weights (Melanoma gets weight 2.0 — we penalize the model more for missing it)
- Saved the best version based on lowest validation loss → `best_skin_cancer_model.h5`

**5. What Happens When You Upload an Image**
```
You upload a photo
      ↓
Backend resizes it to 224×224 and normalizes it
      ↓
Model outputs 7 probability scores (one per lesion type)
      ↓
The class with the highest score = the diagnosis
      ↓
Risk level is assigned (High / Moderate / Low)
      ↓
Result is shown + saved to your scan history
```

### The 7 Classes

| Code | Name | Risk |
|------|------|------|
| `mel` | Melanoma | 🔴 High Risk |
| `bcc` | Basal Cell Carcinoma | 🔴 High Risk |
| `akiec` | Actinic Keratosis | 🔴 High Risk |
| `bkl` | Benign Keratosis | 🟡 Moderate |
| `df` | Dermatofibroma | 🟡 Moderate |
| `vasc` | Vascular Lesion | 🟡 Moderate |
| `nv` | Melanocytic Nevi (mole) | 🟢 Low Risk |

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or 3.11
- Node.js v18+
- The `best_skin_cancer_model.h5` file placed in the `backend/` folder

---

### Step 1 — Start the Backend

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd DermAssist-AI/backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

You should see:
```
✅ Model loaded successfully.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Test it at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs**

---

### Step 2 — Start the Frontend

Open a **second terminal** (keep the backend running) and run:

```bash
cd DermAssist-AI/frontend

npm install       # first time only
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

---

## 🔑 Authentication Flow

```
New user opens the app
      ↓
Redirected to /register → fills form → account created
      ↓
JWT token saved in browser localStorage
      ↓
Every future visit → token verified automatically → logged in instantly
      ↓
Token expires after 24 hours → redirected to /register again
```

Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** — never stored in plain text.

---

## 💾 Database Structure

The app uses **SQLite** (a simple file-based database — no server needed). The file `dermassist.db` is created automatically in the `backend/` folder on first run.

**images** — stores info about each uploaded image
| Column | What it stores |
|--------|---------------|
| id | Unique image ID |
| image_name | Generated filename |

**predictions** — stores every AI scan result
| Column | What it stores |
|--------|---------------|
| id | Unique scan ID |
| predicted_label | e.g. "mel" |

## 🐛 Common Errors & Fixes

**"Registration failed. Please try again."**
→ Check the backend terminal for the actual error
→ Most likely: backend is not running, or bcrypt version issue
→ Fix bcrypt: `pip install bcrypt==4.0.1 --force-reinstall`

**"Inference failed: Input shape mismatch"**
→ The model expects 224×224 images
→ Check `preprocess_for_tflite()` in `main.py` — resize must be `(224, 224)`

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'"**
→ Your virtual environment is not activated
→ Run: `venv\Scripts\activate` then `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**"No module named 'models.predictions'"**
→ Filename is `prediciton.py` (typo, no 's')
→ In `models/__init__.py` make sure it says: `from .prediciton import Prediction`

**Frontend shows blank page or connection refused**
→ Make sure both servers are running simultaneously
→ Backend on port 8000, Frontend on port 3000
